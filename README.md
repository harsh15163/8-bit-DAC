# 8-bit_DAC_design
Analog IC Design - Summer 2021

**Learning Objective :**
1. DAC implementation as a application of current mirror. 
    - Understanding different current mirror biasing circuits,
    - Understanding basic DAC topologies
2. Sampling and re-constructing a sine wave : 
    - signal processing concepts
